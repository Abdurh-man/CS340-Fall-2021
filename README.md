# CS340 Fall 2021

Welcome, this is the repo used to link your GitHub for your class work.

## Instructions

- Fork this repo to your account (use the same GitHub account for this whole class)
- Clone your fork to your machine where you have your development environment installed
- Add a file under `students/` where the filename is `<your-netid>.md` and matches the example format.
- Commit & push this to your fork
- Open a PR to merge your fork's changes into this repo

Once your PR is open, we'll give feedback / review it if anything is wrong, otherwise it'll be merged and you're good to go!

## Teams

If you already know who you want to work with, you can follow this same process to create a file under `teams/`.

Name this file with a proposed name for your team. It should be a markdown file again, and your file and PR should include both GitHub usernames and NetIDs for each team member. You can assign your other team members as PR reviewers, and if every team member approves the PR your team is official! (Given the other team requirements are satisfied like member count.)
