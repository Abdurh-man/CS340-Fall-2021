# CS340 Fall 2021

Welcome, this is the repo used to link your GitHub for your class work.

## Instructions

- Fork this repo to your account (under whichever GitHub account you'll be authoring commits from for this class)
- Clone your fork to your machine where you have your development environment installed
- Add a file under `students/` where the filename is `<your-netid>.md` and matches the example format. (Must at least include netid and GitHub username)
- Commit & push this change to your fork
- Open a PR to merge your fork's changes into this repo

Once your PR is open, we'll give feedback / review it if anything is wrong, otherwise it'll be merged and you're good to go!

After your team has a project repo created, feel free to delete your fork of this repo.

## Teams

If you already know who you want to work with, you can follow this same process to create a file under `teams/`.

Name this file with a proposed name for your team. It should be a markdown file again, and your file and PR should include both GitHub usernames and NetIDs for each team member. If all your team members have already had their personal PR merged and you've all been added to the organization you should assign your other team members as reviewers. Once the whole team approves the PR and meets the project requirements, we'll merge your team's PR and create a repo for your team.
